### Version notes

This version has very little in the way of input validation and error checking
and uses more memory and disk space than it would if it were modified so that
it only created and saved templates needed for the current level of the user,
but it is feature complete. It was compiled with gcc and tested under Suse
Linux 10.3 and compiled with MS Visual Studio and tested under WinXP.
