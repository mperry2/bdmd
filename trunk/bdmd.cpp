	<< "Big Daddy's Math Drills is a simple, effective, free, opensource program for drilling basic addition, subtraction, and multiplication facts.  Compiled binary files are available for Windows XP and Linux compatible systems." << endl << endl

	<< "Installing and Uninstalling" << endl << endl

	<< "For Linux and Windows users, just put the executable binary file and put it in a folder by itself where the user has read, write, and execute permissions.  There are no hooks into the operating system, so no worries.  To uninstall both program and data, delete the folder." << endl << endl

	<< "Operation" << endl << endl

	<< "Just start the program and follow the prompts.  The program works like flash cards, but it's more effective because:" << endl << endl

	<< "1. The program starts out easy, a limited set of small numbers first.  It progressively decreases the frequency of drill for problems that you answer correctly, and increases the frequency of drill for problems you answer wrong." << endl << endl

	<< "2. As you gain in accuracy at a given level, the programe reduces the amount of time allowed for each answer." << endl << endl

	<< "3. When you have mastered the problems at a lower level, the program automatically moves you up to the next level, where you again start out with more time to answer each question.  The problems from old levels still appear from time to time, to make sure you don't forget them, but you get more intensive drill in the newer more unfamiliar material." << endl << endl

	<< "4. When you get tired of doing one kind of problem, you can work on another module." << endl << endl

	<< "5. When you quit, the program saves your profile, so when you restart with the same username you pick up right where you left off.  If you want to start over, just change your username or delete your profile, which is in the same folder as the executable, and is named with the username plus a '.dat' extension." << endl << endl

	<< "6. We recommend that, when you start using the program, you set your Num Lock on and use the number pad on your keyboard, if you have one.  It will not only improve your speed doing the drills, but when you're done you will be handy with an adding machine, too." << endl << endl

{{{
	// Notes to Team:
	//
	// This is what the prototypes (for your files) of and calls to (from here) your addition,
	// subtraction, multiplication, and division modules should look like.
	// 
	// Function prototype and call to addition module:
	// void addModule(Student & s);
	// addModule(s);

	// Function prototype and call to subtraction module:
	// void subModule(Student & s);
	// subModule(s);

	// Function prototype and call to multiplication module:
	// void mltModule(Student & s);
	// mltModule(s);

	// Function prototype and call to division module:
	// void divModule(Student & s);
	// divModule(s);
	//
	// The source code for each module should implement the corresponding function,
	// which uses the classes defined and implemented in Student.h.
	// Your module should use the data and members of the Student object 
	// that is passed to it to do its work, and use the mutator functions 
	// in it and its members to changes such things 
	// as the maximum size of the problems the student is doing, the amount of time 
	// allowed for each problem, and so on.  Please read the specifications 
	// for the program in bdmd.txt carefully so we will all be following the 
	// same designm.
	//
	// In particular, note that the Student object that is passed to your module 
	// has arrays of problem templates called addTemplateArr, subTemplateArr, 
	// mltTemplateArr, and divTemplateArr.  These arrays contain AddTemplate, 
	// SubTemplate, MltTemplate, and DivTemplate objects which represent one example of
	// each possible problem at a given level.  The problem templates are arranged 
	// in the array in order such that to get all the problems in which the addends 
	// (or factors, or the minuend, or the numerator, depending on the type of problem)
	// are from 0 to a given level, you can take the first numUsed items in the 
	// array.  numUsed for each level (defined in terms of 
	// maximum addend, factor, minuend, or numerator,
	// depending on the type of problem) can be calculated in accordance with 
	// the functions below (such as printAddTemplateArr(Student & s)) that 
	// print the set of problem templates for any given level.  You can see 
	// how this works by compiling, linking, and running this file
	// without changes.  You can input levels for addition, subtraction, and 
	// multiplication problems, and see how the right templates are retreived 
	// from the problem template arrays.
	//
	// The problem template arrays should be used by your module each time
	// you generate a problem set for the student.  Note that each problem
	// template in the array (each of which is an instantiation 
	// of AddTemplate, SubTemplate, MltTemplate, or DivTemplate, depending 
	// on the array) has a frequency data member.  First, you can 
	// use the problem array to generate a bag of problems that contains
	// the right number of copies of each of the eligible problems for that level.
	// The right number of copies depends on the frequency attribute of the 
	// problem template.
	//
	// For example, for an addition problem, the right number of copies of the 
	// first problem template in the array is
	// is s.addTemplateArr[0].frequency.  Because these attributes are 
	// protected, you have to use the get methods of the AddTemplate 
	// class: s.getAddTemplateArr()[0].getFrequency().
	// Then, you randomly draw 50 questions from the bag, which are used
	// as the problem set.  When a problem is answered correctly or incorrectly,
	// you use the get and set functions of the appropriate problem template class to 
	// adjust its frequency down or up by an appropriate amount. At the
	// end of the set, you can use the get and set functions in the 
	// Student class to adjust the time allowed, the level, or both.
	// Each time you do a new set, you should generate a new bag with
	// the adjusted frequencies from which to draw the problem set.
	//
	// The addModule(s), subModule(s), and mltModule(s) calls above 
	// should be fully functional once you have written your module
	// to specifications.  You should be able to uncomment the appropriate
	// one and add some cout statements to this file see how your module
	// is working.  I should have the code neede to make divModule(s) 
	// functional soon.
	//
	// While you are working on your modules, I will work the user interface
	// for the main module and on saving and retreiving the Student objects. 
	// I will need your modules, completed to specifications, together with 
	// your documentation as specified in the proposal, by Monday at noon, 
	// in order to integrate, test, confer with you about any problems, and 
	// be ready to demonstrate and turn in the project by Thursday.
	//
	// Whew!
