// Valentin, this is the file where you should gradually add all your code for 
// the addition module. Commit the changes to the repository, 
// as code is added and tested.  Do not commit code that breaks 
// the project.  The project in trunk should always compile, build, and run.

// The stub function below just prints a message when called 
// by main, which is in bdmd.cpp
